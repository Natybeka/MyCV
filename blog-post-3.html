                <p>CSS, which stands for Cascading style sheet, is a tool used to format the layout of webpages including text, tables, and divs. The main advantage of CSS was to help developers create a uniform look across multiple pages.
                    The first version of CSS, CSS1, became the official recommendation in December of 1996. The current recommended version CSS3 became the W3 consortium standard on June 7, 2011 and with it many chages had come into effect
                    . Instead of defining all features in a single, large specification like CSS 2, CSS 3 is divided into several separate documents called "modules". Each module adds new capability or extends features defined in CSS 2, 
                    
                    over preserving backward compatibility.
                    Some modules such as Selectors, Namespaces, Color and Media Queries are considered stable and are either in Candidate Recommendation or Proposed Recommendation status.</p>

                    <h2>Specific Changes and Features in CSS3</h2>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong> The Box-Shadow property:</strong>
                            This feature adds a shadow to an HTML element. Multiple effects can also be added separated by commas. A box shadow is described by X and Y offsets relative to the element, blur and spread radius, and color.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Opacity: </strong>This styling attribute enable customization of an element's transparency. The given value ranges from 1 (the default value) to 0 (fully transparent) 
                        
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Rounded Corners: </strong>
                            Corners of box elements can be rounded using the border-radius attribute. This simple line works effectively with square boxes.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Attribute Selectors: </strong>In addition to ids and classes elements to be styled can be selected using their attributes.</li>
                        <li><strong>New Color Inputs:</strong> with the addition of the Opacity attribute new color inputs were incorporated into CSS3.
                            <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
                                <li><strong>RGBA: </strong>
                                    added alpha input in addition to red,green and blue values for color. alpha signifies how much the color should be transparent.
                                </li>
                                <li><strong>HSL and HSLA:</strong>
                                    The hsl() function define colors using the Hue-saturation-lightness model (HSL). HSL stands for hue, saturation, and lightness - and represents a cylindrical-coordinate representation of colors. hue is measured in degree or rad while the rest are measured in percentages.
                                </li>
                                <li><strong>Gradient Colors: </strong>CSS gradients display smooth transitions between two or more specified colors.</li>
                            </ul> 

                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Addition of :root pseudoclass: </strong> A few more pseudo-class selectors were added in CSS3. The :root selector allows designers to point to the root elements. A total of 19 new pseudoclasses were added to CSS3. These include :nth-child(n), :nth-last-child(n) , :nth-of-type, :enabled ...etc.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Multiple background images: </strong> In CSS3, thereâ€™s no need to include an element for every background image; it provides us with the ability to add more than one background image to any element, even to pseudo-elements.</li>
                    </ol>
